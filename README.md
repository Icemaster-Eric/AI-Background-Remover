# AI-Background-Remover
Erase the background of any image using the current SOTA model! I built this using the newly released Background Erase Network (BEN) and NiceGUI. Weirdly enough it seems like NiceGUI's On Air deployment mode doesn't support image uploads, so I've also deployed a simple flask cdn to Hack Club's Nest service.

I'm hosting the model on my pc locally, so please don't abuse this and have fun!
